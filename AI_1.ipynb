    "<div overflow-wrap: break-word;>This first tutorial will introduce the basic principles of Python. Python is a popular and flexible programming language, which is typically run as interpreted script rather than compiled code. Hence, one of the reasons that it works so well in a browser. It is now one of the most popular languages for AI, machine learning and data science, but it is also used widely in web development, and even in IoT such as with coding for Raspberry Pi. \n",
